# Lab Assignment 5.2 - Ensemble Learning Techniques

This repository contains the implementation of various ensemble learning techniques as a part of the lab assignment for machine learning coursework.

## üìö Overview

The notebook `202201040126_Lab_Assignment_5_2.ipynb` focuses on applying and evaluating different ensemble learning methods, including:

- **Stacking Ensemble** (using a meta-classifier)
- **AdaBoost Ensemble**
- **Voting Ensemble** (both hard and soft voting)

Each method is implemented and compared against baseline individual machine learning models using standard classification metrics.
